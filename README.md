# Smart-Solar-Tracking-System
A smart solar panel tracking system to optimize energy capture by automatically adjusting based on sunlight direction  using Arduino to build a solar tracking system that adjusts the solar panel’s position for maximum sunlight using LDR sensors and servo motors.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Arduino
- C++
- Servo Motors
- Light Dependent Resistors (LDRs)

## 🌟 Features
- Automatically detects sunlight direction using LDRs
- Adjusts solar panel position with servo motors
- Improves energy output compared to fixed panels
  
## 🖥️ Arduino Code
The Arduino code for this project is available in the file: `solar_tracker.ino`
- It reads light intensity from LDR sensors and rotates the servo motor accordingly.
- Upload this file using Arduino IDE.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Upload the Arduino code to your Arduino board.
2. Connect the LDR sensors and servo motor based on the provided circuit diagram.
3. Power the setup and observe the solar panel moving to track sunlight.
